# Introduction
Mopping robot is a desigined robot by the group which is able to mop the desk and the floor. It aims at helping people with chores and could also be regarded as a toy car for kids. The group tried two kinds of sensors which are an ultrsonic sensor [HC-SR04](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Sensors/Proximity/HCSR04.pdf) and an infrared analogue sensor [GP2D12](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ME588/SpecSheets/sharp_gp2d12.pdf). The mopping robot has two modes which are automatic mode and manual mode.  
This project aims at describing how to create such mopping robot by using a Raspberry Pi.
