# Introduction
Today, smart home has become the trend of the times. The emergence of smart homes has not only changed people's lifestyles, but also greatly improved working efficiency and people's happiness. Therefore, this project has established a mopping robot based on the Raspberry Pi. The group tried two kinds of sensors which are an ultrsonic sensor [HC-SR04](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Sensors/Proximity/HCSR04.pdf) and an infrared analogue sensor [GP2D12](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ME588/SpecSheets/sharp_gp2d12.pdf).   
There are two working modes for the mopping robot: manual mode and automatic mode. There is an interface which enables users to choose a mode. The automatic mode makes the mopping robot be able to avoid obstacles automatically. The obstacles are located by an algorithm, and the path when the floor is mopped is random, covering as much as possible to all areas (the area may be cleaned repeatedly). The other mode is the manual control mode. In this mode, the user can control the advancement by pushing buttons on the GUI interface which are forward, backward, left turn, right turn and stop.     
The desigined mopping robot aims at not only freeing people's hands, but also making people's lives more convenient.
